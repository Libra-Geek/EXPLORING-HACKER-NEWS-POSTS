# EXPLORING-HACKER-NEWS-POSTS

In this project, we'll work with a data set of submissions to popular technology site Hacker News. The interest of this lesson lies in the community posts which are targeted towards asking the Hacker News community a question. We would be exploring these kind of posts in order to compare which of the posts categories receive more comments or which one receives more comments when created at a particular time. 

Remember: Coding is tasking but my lessons make it fun to learn. So, let us get ready to crack this!
